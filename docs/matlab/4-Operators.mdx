# Operators - Working with Scalars

In MATLAB Operators work on both scalar and non-scalar data. The following are the operators available in MATLAB

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operatiors
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators

Let's understand how they will perform with scalar values.

## Scalar Arithmetic Operators

Let's assume, a = 22 & b = 2 

| Operator | Operation                                    | Description                                 | Corresponding Functions |
| :------: | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
|    +     | Addition                                     | a + b, results to 24                        | `plus()`                |
|    -     | Subtraction                                  | a - b, results to 20                        | `minus()`               |
|    *     | Multiplication                               | a * b, results to 44                        | `times()`               |
|    /     | Right Division                               | a / b, results to 22                        | `rdivide()`             |
|    \     | Left Division (*a \ b is  similar to b / a*) | a \ b (*similar to b/a*), results to 0.0909 | `ldivide()`             |
|    ^     | Exponentiation                               | a ^ b, results to 484                       | `power()`               |

## Vector Arithmetic Operators



## Matrix Arithmetic Operators



## Relational Operators

Performs comparison operations and based upon the evaluation it will returns logical 1 for true and logical 0 for false.

 Let's take a = 20 and b = 10

| Operator | Operation                | Description                  | Corresponding Functions |
| :------: | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
|    <     | Less than                | a < b, results lo logical 0  | `lt()`                  |
|    <=    | Less than or equal to    | a <= b, results lo logical 0 | `le()`                  |
|    >     | Greater than             | a > b, results lo logical 1  | `gt()`                  |
|    >=    | Greater than or equal to | a >= b, results lo logical 1 | `ge()`                  |
|    ==    | Equal to                 | a == b, results lo logical 0 | `eq()`                  |
|    ~=    | Not equal to             | a ~= b, results lo logical 1 | `ne()`                  |

## Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR and output the result in logical 1 or for true or false respectively.

| Operator | Operation | Description | Corresponding Functions |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| &        |           |             |                         |
| \|       |           |             |                         |
| ~        |           |             |                         |
| xor      |           |             |                         |
| &&       |           |             |                         |
| \|\|     |           |             |                         |
|          |           |             |                         |
|          |           |             |                         |
