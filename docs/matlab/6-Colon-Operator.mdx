# Colon Operator

Colon operator ( `:` ) is used to create vectors, array subscripting and most frequently used in `for` loop operations.

## Creating a Row Vector

Colon operator can be used to create a row vector.

### **Syntax** - 1

```matlab
vec = <initial_val> : <final_val>
```

When initial_val and final_val is specified, then MATLAB creates a row vector starting from initial value to final value (both values are included) with the increment of 1.

#### Example

```matlab
x = 3 : 10;
disp(x);	
```

#### Output

```matlab
3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
```

Initial value is mentioned as 3 and final value is as 10, so MATLAB generates a row vector from 3 to 10 with increment of 1 while including both initial and final values as displayed in the output.

### Syntax - 2

We can also specify our desired incremental value or expression while generating row vector using colon operator.

```matlab
vec = <initial_val> : <incremental_expression> : <final_val>
```

#### Example - 1

```matlab
y = 100 : -5 : 50;
disp(y);
```

#### Output - 1

```
100    95    90    85    80    75    70    65    60    55    50
```

In the above example, we have mentioned -5 as `incremental_expression`, it means that the final generated row vector will be decremented by value of 5 from initial value till it reaches the final value. Make sure that initial value is greater than the final value in these kind of scenarios.

#### Example - 2

```matlab
0:pi/8:pi
```

#### Output  - 2

```
ans =
   Columns 1 through 7
      0    0.3927    0.7854    1.1781    1.5708    1.9635    2.3562
   Columns 8 through 9
      2.7489    3.1416
```

Instead of using positive or negative value at `incremental_expression` we can also use a expression as shown in the above example. It just creates a regualarly spaced vector using `incremental_expression` as increment between expressions.

## Subscripting a Vector using colon operator

We can fetch a particular value from a vector by mentioning the index number of the value as shown below. In MATLAB index starts with 1 not with 0 like in Python. So, if you are trying to fetch 1st value from vector or 1D array mention index number as 1 not 0.

```matlab
vec = [3 4 32 77 45 33 21 90];
disp(vec(2)); % Fetching value 4 from 'vec' vector
```

**Output**

```matlab
4
```

**What if we want to fetch a set of elements from the vector?**

We can get a set of elements from vector or 1D array using colon operator like shown below.

```matlab
vec = [3 4 32 77 45 33 21 90];

% fetching elements of index 2 to 6
disp(vec(2:6);
```

**Output**

```matlab
4    32    77    45    33
```

## Subscripting a Matrix using colon operator

We can also subscript a Matrix and can get a sub matrix from it using colon operator.

```matlab
A = [1 2 3 4; 4 5 6 7; 7 8 9 10];
disp(A);

A(:,2)      % all rows and second column of A
A(:,2:3)    % all rows, second and third column of A
A(2:3,2:3)  % second and third rows and second and third columns
```

**Output**

```matlab
A =
      1     2     3     4
      4     5     6     7
      7     8     9    10

ans =
      2
      5
      8

ans =
      2     3
      5     6
      8     9

ans =
      5     6
      8     9
```
