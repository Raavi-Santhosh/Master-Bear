Conditional statements comes handy when a set of instructions are need to be executed only when a certain condition is met.

The following conditional statements are availabe in MATLAB

- if... statement
- if... else... statement
- if... elseif... elseif.... else statement
- Nested if... statement
- switch... case... statement

## `if` statement

#### Syntax

```matlab
if <conditional_expression>
	statement 1  % if block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n
end

% statements after if
```

Body of `if` will only executed when the `conditional_expression` is evaluated to **true**. If the `conditional_expression` evaluates to **false**, then the first set of code after the end statement will be executed

#### Flow Diagram

![MATLAB if...end statement](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/matlab/images/matlab-if-end-statement.png)

#### Example - 1

```matlab
a = 10;

% check the condition using if statement 
if a < 20 
  % if condition is true then print the following 
  fprintf('a is less than 20\n' );
end

fprintf('value of a is : %d\n', a); % This statement will executed even if block executes or not
```

In the above example, the if condition is evaluated to true so,  line 6 is executed ends the if block.

#### Output

```matlab
a is less than 20
value of a is : 10
```

#### Example - 2

```matlab
a = 30;

% check the condition using if statement 
if a < 20 
  % if condition is true then print the following 
  fprintf('a is less than 20\n' );
end

fprintf('value of a is : %d\n', a); % This statement will executed even if block executes or not
```

In the above example, if block is evaluated to false so if will not execute line 6.

#### Output

```matlab
value of a is : 30
```

## `if... else...` statement

#### Syntax

```matlab
if <conditional_expression>
	statement 1  % if block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n

else
	statement 1  % if block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n

end

% statements after if...else...
```

Body of `if` will only executed when the `conditional_expression` is evaluated to **true**. If the `conditional_expression` evaluates to **false**, then the statements inside the else block will be executed.

![MATLAB if...else statement](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/images/if_else_statement.jpg)

#### Example 

```matlab
a = 100;

% check the boolean condition 
if a < 20 
  % if condition is true then print the following 
  fprintf('a is less than 20\n' );
else
  % if condition is false then print the following 
  fprintf('a is not less than 20\n' );
end
  
fprintf('value of a is : %d\n', a);
```

#### Output

```matlab
a is not less than 20
value of a is : 100
```

## `if... elseif...else...` statement

`if` statement can be followed by one or more `elseif` statements if we want to test many conditions.

While using `if... elseif...else...` statements, there are few points to remember −

- An `if` can have zero or one `else`'s and it must come after any `elseif`.
- An `if` can have zero to many `elseif`'s and they must come before the `else`.

#### Syntax

```matlab
if <conditional_expression>
	statement 1  % if block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n

elseif <conditional_expression>
	statement 1  % elseif block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n

elseif <conditional_expression>
	statement 1  % elseif block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n
	
else <conditional_expression>
	statement 1  % else block starts here
	statement 2
	statement 3
	....
	....
	statement n
end

% statements after if...elseif...
```

#### Example 

```matlab
a = 100;

%check the boolean condition 
if a == 10 
  % if condition is true then print the following 
  fprintf('Value of a is 10\n' );

elseif( a == 20 )
  % if else if condition is true 
  fprintf('Value of a is 20\n' );

elseif a == 30 
	% if else if condition is true  
	fprintf('Value of a is 30\n' );

else
  % if none of the conditions is true '
  fprintf('None of the values are matching\n');
  fprintf('Exact value of a is: %d\n', a );

end
```

#### Output

```matlab
None of the values are matching
Exact value of a is: 100
```

## Nested `if` Statement

A `if` statement inside another `if` statement is called as Nested `if` statement

### Syntax

```matlab
if <conditional_expression1>
   % Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true 
   
   if <conditional_expression2>
      % Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true    
   end

end
```

*We can also use else and elseif inside the nested if statements.*

### Example

```matlab
a = 100;
b = 200;
   % check the boolean condition 
if( a == 100 )
    % if condition is true then check the following 
    if( b == 200 )
        % if condition is true then print the following 
        fprintf('Value of a is 100 and b is 200\n' );
    end

end
fprintf('Exact value of a is : %d\n', a );
fprintf('Exact value of b is : %d\n', b );
```

### Output

```matlab
Value of a is 100 and b is 200
Exact value of a is : 100
Exact value of b is : 200
```

## `switch... case...` Statement

`switch... case...` conditional statement is alternative to `if... elseif...` statement which allows us to execute one set of statements out of several other choices.

### Syntax

```matlab
switch <switch_conditional_expression>
   case <case_conditional_expression1>
      <statements>
   case <case_conditional_expression2>
      <statements>
      ...
      ...
   otherwise
      <statements>
end
```

### Rules to remember

- `switch_conditional_expression` must evaluate to a scalar or string.
- `case_conditional_expression` must evaluate to a scalar or string or a cell array of scalars or strings.
- The switch block tests each case until one of the cases is **true**. 
- A case is true when −
  - For numbers, **eq(case_conditional_expression,switch_conditional_expression)**.
  - For strings, **strcmp(case_conditional_expression,switch_conditional_expression)**.
  - For objects that support the **eq(case_conditional_expression,switch_conditional_expression)**.
  - For a cell array case_conditional_expression, at least one of the  elements of the cell array matches switch_expression, as defined above  for numbers, strings and objects.

### Example

```matlab
grade = 'B';
   switch(grade)
     case 'A' 
        fprintf('Excellent!\n' );
     case 'B' 
        fprintf('Well done\n' );
     case 'C' 
        fprintf('Well done\n' );
     case 'D'
        fprintf('You passed\n' );
     case 'F' 
        fprintf('Better try again\n' );
     otherwise
        fprintf('Invalid grade\n' );
   end
```

### Output

```matlab
Well done
```
