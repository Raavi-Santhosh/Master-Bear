title: Loops
---

Loops allows us to execute set of statements certain number of times. MATLAB provide this behaviour of execution through the following loops.

- `while` loop
- `for` loop

## `while` Loop

`while` loop executes the set of statements inside it as long as the `conditional_expression` is evaluated to **true**.

### Syntax
```matlab
while <conditional_expression>
   <statement 1>
   <statement 2>
   ....
   ....
   <statement n>

end
```

`while` loop executes the set of statements inside it as long as the `conditional_expression` is evaluated to **true**.

- The `while` loop evaluates the `conditional_expression`.
- If the `conditional_expression` is **true**, statements inside the body of `while` loop are executed. Then, the `conditional_expression` is evaluated again.
- The process goes on until the test expression is evaluated to **false**.
- If the test expression is false, the loop terminates (ends).

The `conditional_expression` is termed to be **true** only when it is evaluated to non-empty and contains all non-zero elements(logical 1 or real numbers). Otherwise, the `conditional_expression` is **false**

### Example

```matlab
a = 10;

% while loop execution 
while( a < 20 )
   fprintf('value of a: %d\n', a);
   a = a + 1; % avoiding loop from entering into infinite loop - while loop-control condition

end
```

### Output

```matlab
value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
value of a: 16
value of a: 17
value of a: 18
value of a: 19
```
## `for` loop

### Syntax

```matlab
for <var> = <values>
   <statement 1>
  <statement 2>
  ....
  ....
  ....
  <statement n>
  
end
```
`<values>` can be a vector/array or generated vector using colon notation.

### Example - 1 :- Iterating over vector

```matlab
for a = [24,18,17,23,28]
   disp(a)
end
```

### Output - 1

```
24
18
17
23
28
```

### Example - 2 :- Iterating over vector generated by colon notation

```matlab
for a = 1.0: -0.1: 0.0
   disp(a)
end
```

### Output - 2

```matlab
1
0.90000
0.80000
0.70000
0.60000
0.50000
0.40000
0.30000
0.20000
0.10000
0
```

### Example - 3 :- Iterating over 2D Matrix

```matlab
mat = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
disp(mat);

for m = mat
    fprintf("%d\n",m);
end
```

### Output - 3

```matlab
1
4
7
2
5
8
3
6
9
```

When iterating over matrices, the flow of iteration will go along with the columns

# Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements changes the flow of execution inside the loop. MATLAB supports both `break` and `continue` statements

## `break` statement

Whenever execution control encounters `break` statement the immediatly if terminates the execution of the respective loop either it may be `while` or `for` loop.

![MATLAB break statement](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/images/cpp_break_statement.jpg)

### Example

```matlab
a =10;

% while loop execution 
while(a <20)
   fprintf('value of a: %d\n',a);
   a =a+1;

   if(a >15)%terminate the loop using break statement 
      break;
      fprintf("This is after break statement which will not execute");
  end

end
```

### Output

```matlab
value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
```

As soon as `a` value becomes greater than 15, if condition at line 8 is satisfied and executed the break statement which will terminate the `while` loop. However the `fprintf()` after the `break` statement will not execute because the control of execution will come out of the loop as soon as `break` statement is encountered.

## `continue` statement

In for and while loop`continue` statement is used to pass the execution control to the next iteration by skiping the statements below it.

![MATLAB continue statement](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/images/cpp_continue_statement.jpg)


### Example

```matlab
a = 9;

%while loop execution 
while a < 20
   a = a + 1; 
   if a == 15
      % skip the iteration 
      continue;
   end 
    fprintf('value of a: %d\n', a);

end
```

### Output

```matlab
value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 16
value of a: 17
value of a: 18
value of a: 19
value of a: 20
```
In the above example, when the value of `a` becomes 15 which satisfies the `if` statement and triggers the `continue` statement which will end up skipping the current iteration and control goes back to the loop again.c
