# Vectors & Matrices

Vector is a one dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows us to create and work with two type of vectors

- Row Vectors
- Column Vectors

### Row Vectors

Row Vectors are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.

```matlab
r = [7 8 9 10 11]
```

**Output**

```matlab
r =

   7    8    9   10   11 
```

### Column Vectors

Column vectors are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit the elements.

```matlab
c = [7;  8;  9;  10; 11]
```

```matlab
c =
      7       
      8       
      9       
      10       
      11  
```

*Note: Creating a vector and subscripting it using colon notation is already discussed in **Colon Operator** topic please refer to it*
